On the high seas where the winds wildly blow,
Lived a fierce pirate with tales to show.
He wore a hat with a feather so fine,
And drank his rum as the stars would shine.

The pirate’s ship was a fearsome sight,
With black sails billowing in the moonlit night.
Treasure maps hidden, secrets untold,
Chests overflowing with jewels and gold.

“Ahoy!” he shouted, “to the horizon we steer,
For a pirate’s heart knows neither doubt nor fear!”
Through storms and squalls, through danger they’d sail,
Chasing the whispers of a legendary tale.

But the pirate was more than a plunderer bold,
His dreams were of freedom, not just of gold.
A rogue of the seas, with a heart untamed,
The pirate lived by the life he claimed.

And so his name, like the ocean’s roar,
Echoed forever on every shore.
